			<h2>Frozen Frontier</h2>
			<p>Here’s your first level and it’s not an easy one! Here in this land, it is frozen and it’s up to you to melt it down to size! All the fans have been frozen over and a disgruntled penguin named Larry is unhappy. Here you’ll have to use new abilities! You will have to hop, skip and jump your way over frozen obstacles but some enemies won’t make it easy. Molarch’s puppets are after you in ice skates, but your new tongue tackle can turn those bad guys into snow cones. However, watch out! Rumour has it the dragon around these parts is angry about trespassers so keep on your toes. In this level you’ll make new discoveries like:</p> 
			<ul>
				<li>	The crystal ball which can help you uncover new secrets beyond the ice!
				</li>
				<li>
					An ant's nest that'll regain the health you lost!
				</li>
				<li>
					And many more to be uncovered with your journey around the icy plane!
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p> Prehaps you can turn a snowed-in nightmare into a tropical paradise! </p>

			<h2>Jungle Jamboree:</h2>
			<p>Monsters lurk and secrets await within the jungle. You get taught how to swing on vines and jump on toadstools. Help the biggest Venus fly trap on the land with a bad case of throat pain, climb inside and be doctor toad if you dare. Here the puppets have a new trick, the monkey puppets are fast and moving be prepared to use the weapon you found, the gumshoe slinger to aim and fire a slimeball at those nasty monkeys. Angry weeds may attack you too be careful of what you walk into. Stay alert because someone might be mad, you’re doing some weed-whacking. Be sure to discover the rocky caverns inside the jungle. You might find a long-lost treasure a lousy young explorer has been looking for in this jungle for years or encounter the terrifying spider’s den. From fish to plants everyone seems to need a hand in the chaos of the jungle.</p>

			<h2>Cloudy Kingdom:</h2>
			<p>People can be real airheads in the cloudy kingdom, but try not to have your head in the clouds! The puppets are out running loose in the kingdom, and some can be real tornados when their angry so avoid them till they go away! The king of the kingdom is hosting a party it’s your job to hand out invitations to everyone within the kingdom! Some may only accept it if you give them something in return so do your best to keep your promise to the king! You are even allowed to attend but a real party pooper is in the kingdom.

			<h2>Molarch's Lagoon</h2>
			<p>Ah behind the scenes, the place where your favourite things get made by fishes? Molarch’s taken his industry further than underground. The deep blue depths of the ocean allow you to explore the things never explored. Toads now can breathe underwater thanks to Babble’s scuba helmet! However, Molarch is aware of your intrusion and his minions are on alert, some puppets are on guard. Don’t be in the light of their flashlight or you’ll be harpooned! So, kick 'em in the butt to know you mean fishy business. Get on the good side of your favourite actors by being their personal assistant. Maybe they’ll reward you with a shard, a card, or an inside scoop in how to defeat the raging lion. Perhaps even all three! The assistant manager is a real clam head though and doesn’t like nosy toads getting in the way of the business!</p>

			<h2>Office of Molarch</h2>
			<p>The final land, you’re in the office of Molarch. Your final test to reach Molarch. The secretary doesn’t let you in, so you’ll have to use your head to get in.

			<ul>
				<li>
					Pits of lava
				</li>
				<li>
					Laser security to escape from
				</li>
				<li>
					Challenging puzzles to solve
				</li>
				<li>
					and more lies for you to complete your journey!
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
